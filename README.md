# Introduction
Hello there!

This is a personal project made by Kevin Ramos.

# Product Vision
Have you ever had trouble coming up with a unique pickup line to separate you from the many others on dating websites? 
I hope to provide a dedicated solution to your icebreaker-related woes with this iOS app. Who knows - maybe one day we can integrate this in Tinder itself!

I will be creating an application for iOS that allows one to enter a topic or name to search for pickup lines. The user will then be presented with a list of pickup lines that can be used. As a reach goal, I want to be able to determine a method to 'rank' these pickup lines for measures of success.
